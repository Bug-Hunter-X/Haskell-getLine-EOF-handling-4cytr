This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming involving the `getLine` function and its failure to handle end-of-file (EOF) conditions.  The `bug.hs` file contains code that throws a runtime exception when it receives EOF; `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version that gracefully handles this case.  The issue arises from pattern matching on the result of `getLine` without considering the possibility of an empty string, which `getLine` returns upon receiving EOF.  The solution leverages the Maybe monad to safely handle potential failures.
