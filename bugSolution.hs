The improved version uses the `Maybe` monad to handle the potential failure of `getLine`.  If `getLine` returns an empty string (EOF), the `Maybe` will contain `Nothing`. Otherwise, it contains `Just` the input string. This allows for safe pattern matching without runtime exceptions.

```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  inputMaybe <- fmap (Just) getLine
  case inputMaybe of
    Just "hello" -> putStrLn "Hello back!"
    Just "goodbye" -> putStrLn "Goodbye!"
    Just _ -> putStrLn "I didn't understand that."
    Nothing -> putStrLn "End of input received."
```
