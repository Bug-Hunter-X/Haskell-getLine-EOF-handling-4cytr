This code suffers from a common issue in Haskell: it doesn't handle the possibility that `getLine` might fail.  If the program receives an end-of-file (EOF) signal,  `getLine` will return an empty string, leading to a runtime error in the pattern matching.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  input <- getLine
  case input of
    "hello" -> putStrLn "Hello back!"
    "goodbye" -> putStrLn "Goodbye!"
    _ -> putStrLn "I didn't understand that."
```
